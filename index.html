        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>üß† Biologist</h2>
            <p>From my time as an arborist to working in a genetics lab, I've always been driven by a fascination with the natural world and a desire to learn. My curiosity led me to research positions at Clemson University and later in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where I learned how to lead a strong team and manage large-scale projects. In 2024, I earned my master's degree in Agribusiness while working full-time as a biologist.</p>

            <h2>üçé Food System Economics</h2>
            <p>My passion is to make healthy, affordable food more accessible. To do this, I am developing a new economic framework called "The Decision Economy," which examines how consumers outsource their choices to suppliers. I believe this framework can be used to build a "decision-making as a service (DaaS)" system for food, which would align unexpected, but powerful stakeholders to create a more efficient and beneficial market. This theory also explores the idea of "Decision Monopolies"‚Äîa new form of market power where firms control the very point of consumer choice.</p>

            <h2>üèãÔ∏è Athletic Pursuits</h2>
            <p>I've always had a competitive spirit and a love for hard physical training. My athletic pursuits have included running, rock climbing, grappling, and weightlifting. After overcoming a heart condition caused by overtraining (PAFIYAMA), I've learned to have a healthier relationship with physical activity and now train for the pure enjoyment of it. I recently attended my first USA Bobsled rookie camp where I pushed for the first time on the ice.</p>

            <h2>üé≤ Magic: The Gathering</h2>
            <p>In December 2024, I started playing Magic: The Gathering. I have quickly ascended the ranks to become a top 1000 player globally. My playstyle is unconventional, goes against "the meta", and relies on creating many unpredictable lines that I can navigate based on new information.</p>
